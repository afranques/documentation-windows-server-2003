# Documentation Windows Server 2003
Documentation (in Spanish) showing all the necessary steps to:

1. Set up a blog site with WordPress on our own Windows Server 2003. The documentation also shows how to install PHP over IIS and MySQL.
2. Install Exchange Server 2003 in order for the users of our (made-up) company domain to be able to send/receive (and recover in case of accidental deletions) emails.
